QR code conversion parameters are stored in a structure with the following
fields:

"qrsize" is the width of the QR code, in _code_ pixels (not image pixels).
"blockpitch" is the distance between centres of generated mesh code pixels.
"blockwidth" is the width of generated mesh code pixels.
"blockheight" is the height of the generated pixels (spanning z=0..height).
"slabheight" is the height of the slab underneath the pixels (z=-height..0).

(This is the end of the file.)
